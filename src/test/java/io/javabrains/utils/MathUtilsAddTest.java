Scenario 1: Test Addition with Positive Numbers

Details:
 TestName: testAdditionWithPositiveNumbers
 Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the add method by adding two positive integers.
 Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required as inputs are method parameters.
  Act: Invoke the add method with two positive integers e.g., add(2, 3).
  Assert: Verify the result using the JUnit assert method to check that the outcome equals 5.
 Validation:
  The assertion verifies whether the method correctly adds the two positive integers. This is essential to ensure the accurate computation of addition operations within the application.

Scenario 2: Test Addition with Negative Numbers

Details:
 TestName: testAdditionWithNegativeNumbers
 Description: This test checks whether the addition of negative numbers functions correctly.
 Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required as inputs are method parameters.
  Act: Invoke the add method with two negative integers e.g., add(-3, -2).
  Assert: Use the JUnit assert method to check that the output equals -5.
 Validation:
  The objective of this assertion is to verify that the method operates accurately when dealing with negative numbers. This is important to validate that regardless of the input provided, the method behaves as expected.

Scenario 3: Test Addition with Zero

Details:
 TestName: testAdditionWithZero
 Description: This test aims to verify the correctness of the method's behavior when one of the numbers to be added is zero.
 Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required as inputs are method parameters.
  Act: Invoke the add method with a zero and a positive integer e.g., add(0, 3).
  Assert: Use JUnit assert method to confirm that the result equals 3.
 Validation:
  The assertion verifies whether the addition operation, when given zero and an integer, returns the integer as the outcome. This is crucial as zero is an identity element in addition and should not affect the result.

Scenario 4: Test Addition with Large Numbers

Details:
 TestName: testAdditionWithLargeNumbers
 Description: The aim of this test is to check if the method handles large-size integers appropriately.
 Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required as inputs are method parameters.
  Act: Invoke the add method with two large integers e.g., add(1000000000, 2000000000).
  Assert: Use JUnit assert method to ascertain that the result matches the expected outcome.
 Validation:
  This assertion verifies the method's ability to handle large numbers. This check is essential for applications dealing with large-scale computations.

Scenario 5: Test Addition with Numbers Resulting in Overflow

Details:
 TestName: testAdditionWithNumberOverFlow
 Description: This test is designed to check how the method handles integer overflow situations.
 Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required as inputs are method parameters.
  Act: Invoke the add method with two integers whose sum exceeds the maximum limit of integers e.g., add(Integer.MAX_VALUE, 5).
  Assert: Use JUnit assert method to check an arithmetic exception or check if the output is negative.
 Validation:
  This assurance checks the method's robustness against extreme cases, ensuring that the application does not crash during such scenarios and handles exceptions correctly.
