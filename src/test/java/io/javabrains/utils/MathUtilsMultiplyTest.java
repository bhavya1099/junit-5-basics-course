================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No exception handling (CWE-390)
Issue: The method multiply() does not use any exception handling. If an error occurs during the multiplication of 'a' and 'b', the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.
Solution: Use try-catch blocks to identify possible exceptions. Handle exceptions in an appropriate way that will not interrupt the application flow.

Vulnerability: Lack of input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The multiply() method accepts any integer inputs, which might lead to unexpected results, such as Arithmetic Overflow if the input values are too large.
Solution: Implement input validation and restrict the range of acceptable values for 'a' and 'b'. Detect and reject any invalid inputs before performing any operation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Multiply With Positive Numbers

Details:
    TestName: testMultiplyWithPositiveNumbers
    Description: This test aims to validate the multiply method when given two positive integer inputs. The function should return the correct multiplication result of the two input numbers.
Execution:
    Arrange: Assign 8 and 9 to variables a and b.
    Act: Invoke the multiply method with the variables a and b.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned result is 72.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the function correctly multiplies two positive integers. It confirms the accuracy of the method under normal working conditions.

Scenario 2: Test Multiply With Negative Numbers

Details:
    TestName: testMultiplyWithNegativeNumbers
    Description: To check if the multiply function gives out the correct multiplication output when given two negative integer inputs.
Execution:
    Arrange: Assign -5 and -10 to variables a and b.
    Act: Then, call the multiply method using a and b.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to confirm that the returned output is 50.
Validation:
    This verifies that the function can properly multiply two negative integers. It further ensures the function's validity with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test Multiply With Zero

Details:
    TestName: testMultiplyWithZero
    Description: To validate whether the multiply function correctly returns zero when either of its integer inputs is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: Assign 0 and 5 to variables a and b.
    Act: After that, invoke the multiply method by passing a and b as inputs.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned result is 0.
Validation:
    This test verifies that the function correctly returns zero when any of the inputs is zero. It ensures that the multiplication operation includes the zero property.

Scenario 4: Test multiply with positive and negative numbers

Details:
    TestName: testMultiplyWithPositiveNegativeNumbers
    Description: This test aims to verify if the multiply function correctly multiplies a positive integer with a negative integer.
Execution:
    Arrange: Assign -6 to a and 7 to b.
    Act: Invoke the multiply method with a and b as parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned result is -42.
Validation:
    The built test confirms that the function correctly multiplies a negative integer by a positive integer. It assures the accuracy of the method under different conditions.
