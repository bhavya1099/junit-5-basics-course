Scenario 1: Testing multiplication with positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: The test aims to check whether the multiplication operation is working correctly with positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is required, as the method works directly with the numbers passed to it.
    Act: Invoke the multiply method with two positive integers.
    Assert: Verify that the result returned by the method matches the expected product of the two positive integers.
  Validation:
    This test validates the basic functionality of multiplication with positive numbers. It checks if the product calculated by the multiply method matches the expected result, thus affirming the correctness of the method.

Scenario 2: Testing multiplication with zero
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyWithZero
  Description: The test checks whether the multiplication operation is properly handled when one or both numbers are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is needed.
    Act: Invoke the multiply method with one or both parameters as zero.
    Assert: Confirm that the result of the multiplication operation is zero.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the multiply method correctly implements the property of zero in multiplication, which states that any number multiplied by zero results in zero.

Scenario 3: Testing multiplication with negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: The test checks the correct handling of multiplication with negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
    Act: Invoke the multiply method with two negative integers.
    Assert: Compare the return value to the expected positive result (since the multiplication of two negative numbers results in a positive).
  Validation:
    This test validates the correct handling of negative numbers in a multiplication operation according to the mathematical rule.

Scenario 4: Testing multiplication with large numbers
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyWithLargeNumbers
  Description: The test checks whether the multiplication method can handle scenarios with large integer numbers without causing an overflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is needed.
    Act: Invoke the multiply method with two large integer parameters.
    Assert: Check if the returned result matches the expected product, or if an overflow exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    This test validates whether the method can correctly handle multiplication for larger numbers and checks if it can properly handle or report overflow situations if they occur.

Scenario 5: Testing multiplication with a combination of positive and negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: testMultiplyWithMixedSignNumbers
  Description: The test checks the correct handling of multiplication with both positive and negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is needed.
    Act: Invoke the multiply method with one positive and one negative integer.
    Assert: Confirm that the result of the multiplication is a negative number.
  Validation:
    This test assures the correct handling of numbers of mixed sign, and checks multiplication is in accordance with the mathematical rule stating that a positive number multiplied by a negative one results in a negative number.
